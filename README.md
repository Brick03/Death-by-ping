# Dos-attacts-using-ping
In accordance to the computer misues act, do not expose to an network you do not own or not have written premision 

This project is my personal research on Dos attacks using the ping command and how I could bypass security systems from blocking the attacks

I will be using kali linux as my pentesting disto and both Ubuntu linux and windows 10 as my victim machine and will be using GNS3 VM as my network
